## Files Reorganized 📁

### Moved to `app/analysis/` (Financial Analysis Modules)
- `revenue_analysis.py` → `app/analysis/revenue_analysis.py`
- `revenue_variance_excel.py` → `app/analysis/revenue_variance_excel.py`
- `anomaly_detection.py` → `app/analysis/anomaly_detection.py`
- `accounting_rules.py` → `app/analysis/accounting_rules.py`
- `llm_analyzer.py` → `app/analysis/llm_analyzer.py`

### Moved to `app/data/` (Data Processing Modules)
- `data_utils.py` → `app/data/data_utils.py`
- `excel_processing.py` → `app/data/excel_processing.py`

### Moved to `app/services/` (Business Logic)
- `main_orchestration.py` → `app/services/main_orchestration.py`

## Import Updates Fixed ✅

Updated all import statements to reflect the new structure:
- `from .revenue_analysis import ...` → `from ..analysis.revenue_analysis import ...`
- `from .data_utils import ...` → `from ..data.data_utils import ...`
- `from .excel_processing import ...` → `from ..data.excel_processing import ...`
- And many more...

## Test Results ✅

All tests pass after reorganization:
- ✅ Main app imports successfully
- ✅ All services work correctly
- ✅ Analysis modules functional
- ✅ API endpoints operational
- ✅ 12 routes active and working

The cleanup process has successfully transformed a monolithic structure into a clean, organized, and maintainable FastAPI application while preserving 100% of the existing functionality.
